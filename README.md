# About this App

I created this application for my son, a tennis fanatic, in the hope of building geographic knowledge and an understanding of how tennis can connect us all. The application was initially built using Google AI Studio. 

The application is hosted via GitHub Pages and available @ https://tnriley.github.io/2025-ATP-Tournament-Explorer/
